\Abstract{Fragmentation properties are a crucial component of military weaponeering, where the fundamental goal is to create the optimal weapons package for mission accomplishment, while minimizing collateral damage. Additive manufacturing presents an avenue towards tailoring a warhead's design to a specific target set, allowing weapons experts to develop efficient attack solutions, further reducing unintended consequences, while improving aircraft survivability. Understanding the fragmentation properties of additively manufactured materials under explosive loading is needed before they are utilized in weaponry applications. This research will examine the fracture behavior of metal casings produced by additive manufacturing and the resulting fragment velocity and mass distributions through experimental analysis.
